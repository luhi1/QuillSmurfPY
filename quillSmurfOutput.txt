My father is the man who heads and leads our family; he brings the family into reality.
In a real sense, though, my father anticipates the needs of the times and raises his family by taking on all the responsibilities and duties to give them the necessary shape.
Despite his financial weakness, my poor father does not hesitate to work hard to increase his earnings for my sake, eat a little less, but does not hesitate to take care of me.
